# Wave-Hands-Like-Clouds*

As a worn down Weather God, things were never going to go smoothly. Worshippers are never satisfied. 

"Leaps of Faith" they said, "That's what will get you followers!"

"Yeah, right" Not easy, when all you have are cloud hands...

This is a game for LD46 https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46 AND MiniJam52 https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-52-summit with the themes of "Keep it alive" (LD) and "Summit" (MJ) but also the constraint of WASD and/or Arrow keys only for control; MJ has a pre-announced theme, but the constraint is announced when the jam begins. So, like my previous (broken, incomplete) game Replic8R, I will be doing all of the theminess in one massive failure, to get the initial creative juices flowing.

\* I teach Tai Chi, as well as other thngs, and "Wave JHands Like Clouds" is part of the form, so extra outside inspiration
:-)
